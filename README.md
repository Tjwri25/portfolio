# Updated Portfolio 
 
## Description
I updated my portfolio to add a few of my finished projects, and also an updated resume, linkedIn and Github profiles. I really liked the design of my original portfolio, so I wanted to keep the same theme. I changed around a number of things to make it even more responsive than before.
